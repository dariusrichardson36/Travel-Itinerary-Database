# 🧳 Travel Itinerary Management Database

This project is a relational travel itinerary database built in MySQL Workbench. It models users, trip plans, attractions, and reviews using a fully normalized schema with foreign keys, entity-relationship diagrams, and advanced SQL queries.

## 📐 ER Design & Structure

- Designed an Enhanced ER (EER) model to capture core relationships between users, destinations, trip plans, and travel attractions.
- Transformed the EER diagram into a normalized relational schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and associative tables.
